## ‚≠ê ABOUT US

Remember the time when you were so engrossed into that particular tune or background music from your favorite movie but just couldn't find the name of the song after countless searches on Google? [Flix and Tunes](https://flix-and-tunes.web.app) can help you with that. It is a place to help facilitate your search for tracks and playlists specifically related to movies. You don't have to type out the name of the whole movie as well. I mean, who wants to type out **'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'** just to find out a track? üòÜ Here, you can just type out a word or two, find out your movie from the list and head straight to the tunes.

On clicking over a movie, a card will pop out with details to make sure the correct movie is chosen. The details include the movie poster, language, release year, genre, popularity, overview and if it contains explicit-content.

On clicking over 'Find Playlists', it will be redirected to the results page with all tracks and playlists available in Spotify for that particular movie. Tracks and Playlists are available separately and can be toggled easily through the radio button. All tracks and playlists have the option to redirect you to Spotify where you can easily add them to your playlists or just listen. üòÑ
